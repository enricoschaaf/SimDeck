# Contributing

This page covers local setup, checks, and the boundaries to keep in mind when changing SimDeck.

## Setup

Requirements:

- macOS with Xcode and iOS Simulator runtimes.
- Node.js 18 or newer.
- Rust stable.
- x264 (`brew install x264`).
- Optional Android SDK tools for Android emulator work.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/NativeScript/SimDeck.git
cd SimDeck
npm install
npm run build
```

Run the built CLI:

```sh
./build/simdeck
```

Run the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

The server log is written to `build/cli.log`.

## Repository map

| Folder                    | Purpose                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `packages/server/`        | CLI entrypoint, service, API, stream transport, metrics |
| `packages/server/native/` | macOS simulator bridge                                  |
| `packages/client/`        | Browser UI                                              |
| `packages/`               | Inspectors, VS Code extension, and `simdeck/test`       |
| `scripts/`                | Build, package, and test helpers                        |
| `docs/`                   | VitePress documentation                                 |

## Working rules

- Keep simulator-native logic in `packages/server/native/`.
- Keep server behavior in `packages/server/`.
- Keep browser presentation in `packages/client/`.
- Keep runtime inspector logic in the matching `packages/*-inspector` package.
- Prefer a stable CLI command or API route over hidden environment behavior.
- Update docs when changing CLI flags, API routes, stream behavior, or inspector methods.

## Build and check

```sh
npm run format
npm run lint
npm run test
npm run ci
```

What `npm run ci` covers:

1. Formatting and lint checks.
2. Full build.
3. Rust and client tests.
4. VS Code extension package.

## Integration tests

iOS:

```sh
npm run build:cli
npm run build:client
npm run test:integration:cli
```

Verbose iOS run:

```sh
npm run test:integration:cli:verbose
```

Android:

```sh
npm run build:cli
npm run build:simdeck-test
npm run test:integration:android
```

Useful variables:

| Variable                                 | Purpose                         |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `SIMDECK_INTEGRATION_VERBOSE=1`          | Print more detail               |
| `SIMDECK_INTEGRATION_SHOW_SIMULATOR=1`   | Show Simulator.app during tests |
| `SIMDECK_INTEGRATION_KEEP_SIMULATOR=1`   | Keep temporary iOS simulator    |
| `SIMDECK_INTEGRATION_ANDROID_AVD=<name>` | Pick an Android AVD             |
| `SIMDECK_INTEGRATION_BOOT_ANDROID=1`     | Boot Android locally            |

## Docs

```sh
npm run docs:dev
npm run docs:build
```

The docs site lives under `docs/` and deploys to GitHub Pages from `.github/workflows/docs.yml`.

## Issues and PRs

For simulator or stream bugs, include:

- Reproduction steps.
- `simdeck --version`.
- macOS and Xcode versions.
- Foreground service output or `build/cli.log`.
- Any relevant screenshots or CLI output.
